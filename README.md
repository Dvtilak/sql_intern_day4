# E-Commerce Database â€“ Task 4: Aggregate Functions & Grouping

This task focuses on writing SQL queries that utilize aggregate functions such as `COUNT()` and `SUM()` along with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses to analyze the E-commerce database.


## Objective

- Summarize order and product data using SQL aggregation
- Understand grouping of results by key identifiers
- Apply conditional filtering to grouped data using `HAVING`

## Queries Covered

- Count of returned items per product
- Orders that include more than one item
- Quantity count for each product
- Grouping by product and order IDs

## Key Aggregate Query Use Cases

- **Orders per Customer**: Counts how many orders each customer placed
- **Average Price per Category**: Calculates category-wise average pricing
- **Revenue per Product**: Computes total revenue per product using `unitprice Ã— quantity`
- **Return Count per Product**: Tallies returned items grouped by product
- **Total Quantity Sold per Product**: Sums all units sold per product
- **Popular Products**: Filters products ordered more than twice
- **Valuable Customers**: Highlights customers with more than one order
- **Average Discount per Product**: Tracks product-level average discounts
- **Orders with Multiple Items**: Lists orders containing more than one product

## Highlights & Concepts

`COUNT()`   -->   Count number of rows or grouped records      
`SUM()`     -->   Add up numeric values like quantity or revenue 
`AVG()`     -->   Compute average values (e.g., price, discount)
`GROUP BY`  -->   Group rows by columns like `productid`     
`HAVING`    -->   Filter results **after** grouping
